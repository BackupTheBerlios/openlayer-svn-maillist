   trunk/Makefile

   trunk/utils/glyphkeeper/gk-makefile-win32
Modified:
   trunk/INSTALL
   trunk/default.cbd
Log:
Removed the Makefile, it is no longer needed. Everything has been moved over to cbuild. Added the sources to GlyphKeeper in order to build it with cbuild. Added two new targets to the cbuild script, loadpng and glyphkeeper, which will build and install the libraries respectively. Adding the GK sources should make it easier for someone to install that now, which is temporary for the time being until I can get opengl working and tidy up the internal freetype. Updated the INSTALL file as well.
